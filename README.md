# MenuAggregator
Application for cafe's to update menus and for the POS team to track changes

This application is used by the cafe's to send in weekly menu changes to the POS team.  The POS team can launch the application and be showncafes that have menu item changes, and which items have changed.  When the application is launched it will get the username of the user who is logged onto the computer and use that to find their associated cafe, if the cafe is built. The application will also use this information to take the user to the correct part of the application(cafe use, or POS team use)Only menu item's that have changed will be displayed in the changes section. This project uses connects to a SQLServer Database with 5 tables that I designed.
